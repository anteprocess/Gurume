# Gurume
Food recipes searching application made with kotlin. I`m currently making this application as a prototype that can be used for other projects.

# How to run this project: 
1. Clone development branch
2. Since I won`t be pushing the api key, you will have to create the API key from spoonacular developer website. And add that api key into variable(API_KEY) in the Constants.kt 
3. Just run it. If it doesn't work, clean or rebuild the project and use the latest android studio environment.
